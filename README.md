# XML-project
Repository for our project for the course XML technologies for semantic web at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics. 
This project implements an IT companies catalog, utilizing XML technologies to manage and validate data. It includes:

- **XSD Validation**: Ensures the correctness and structure of the XML data.
- **DTD Validation**: Provides an additional layer of validation by defining the structure, legal elements, and attributes in a simpler syntax.
- **XSLT Transformation**: Used to transform XML data into a human-readable format (HTML).
- **CSS Styling**: Provides a visual representation of the data by styling the transformed output.
